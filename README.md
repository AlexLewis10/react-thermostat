## React Thermostat

This is a simple project in which I was able to learn the basics of React as well as testing with Enzyme.

Deployed: http://thermo-react.surge.sh/

### Functions
- Increase the temperature up or down
- Minimum temperature is 10C
- Max temperature is 25C when power saving mode is on.
- Max temperature is 32C when power saving mode is off.
- Default temp resets the temperature to 20C
- If you are away from home, check the weather and set your thermostat accordingly.


#### Techs
- JavaScript, React
- Jest, Enzyme
- Axios for API request
  
To run locally simply clone and run `npm install`

#### Further work:
- Show low, medium or high energy usage.
- Tests for the API using mocking
- Add positive test for Temp: and Weather:
